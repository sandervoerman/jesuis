# Jesuis

Jesuis is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for profile pages. It is based on Jekyll's default [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) theme and Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme.

## Installation

### As a remote theme

If your site is hosted on GitHub Pages, you can add the theme remotely:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add the following line to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: yourname/jesuis
```


### As a regular theme

Jesuis is not gem-based, but you can use it as a regular Jekyll theme by
cloning it as the starting point of your own site, or by merging it into
your existing website.


## Upstream Minima version

The `upstream-minima` branch points to a customized merge commit that integrates
various development branches from the upstream Minima project before they are
merged into the Jesuis `master` branch.


## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](/LICENSE.txt).
